# General Information - "Training Wheels code" inside. 
First Repo - contains several projects written over the course of self-instruction (roughly 6 weeks of learning)

Most of these scripts are meant to manipulate data within the storage structure of my home lab

There will be a second repository specific to my Dungeons & Dragons "table aid" scripts. Most of these will also be built specifically to interact with my chosen file organization methods.
It will contain a README with more detail.

#...I know these aren't perfect. They're my first few scripts and I have no formal educators assisting in bugfix/clean-up.
